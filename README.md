# Claim Shuffle Bot

**Claim Shuffle Bot** is a tool that helps users automatically claim promotion codes via a Chrome-based extension. With easy integration, this bot simplifies the process of claiming codes without the need for manual interaction.

## Features

- **Chrome Extension-Based:** This bot operates through a Chrome extension that automatically detects and processes promotional codes as you browse supported platforms.
- **Auto Claim:** The bot automatically detects promotion codes and claims them on your behalf.
- **Instant Notifications:** Once a code is successfully claimed, you will receive a notification via Telegram.
- **Multiple Code Categories:** The bot supports various types of promotion codes such as:
  - **Daily Code**
  - **HighRollers Code**
  - **Kick Code**
- **Automatic Format Cleanup:** Removes special characters to display codes in a clean and simple format.

## How It Works

1. **Install the Extension**:
    - Add the extension to your Chrome browser via the link (include the extension link here).
    - Configure your Telegram API Token to receive claim notifications.

2. **Automatic Code Claiming**:
    - The extension will monitor pages and automatically capture promotion codes as they appear.
    - Codes will be claimed automatically, and you'll receive a confirmation via Telegram.

3. **Telegram Notifications**:
    - The messages you receive will look like this:
      ```
      ðŸ”” Code <promotion_code> - Promotion code redeemed successfully.
      Username: <username>
      ```
